## Issues Resolved:

### 1. Info Cards
- Changed background from `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95)` to solid `var(--white)` for better readability
- Added `border: 2px solid var(--british-navy)` for better definition
- Hover state now changes border color to red instead of background

### 2. Feature List
- Added background to each feature item: `background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`
- Added backdrop filter for glassmorphism effect
- Changed checkmark background from transparent to `var(--british-red)` with white text
- Added padding to each feature item for better spacing
- Reduced font size slightly for better fit

### 3. Form Card
- Added navy border to match info cards
- Ensured proper white background for maximum contrast

### 4. Desktop Layout
- Added proper gap adjustments for desktop view
- Increased feature item font size on larger screens
- Better spacing between info wrapper sections

## Files Modified:
- `/assets/css/daycare.css` - Lines 2000-2240 (Contact section styles)

## Visual Improvements:
1. **Readability**: All text is now clearly visible with proper contrast
2. **Consistency**: All cards have matching borders and shadows
